# Anti Broker Full Stack Web

This project is basically based on the real time problems of having call centres specially for the complaints done by various stores for the failure of a particular equipment which inturn is given to the particular service provider who can handle the problem by the call centres. This project helps to make the direct communication between the service providers and the stores which removes the need of call-centres. (eg. mcdonalds, dominos and many more)
